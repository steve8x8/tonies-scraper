Scrapers to update tonies.json

## README remains to be written

## CAVEATS
The code has been written and tested on macOS 12.6.1 Monterey, with lots of tools installed via HomeBrew.
To run the scripts, you will need
 * `json_pp` for "pretty-printing" JSON files (provided with `perl`) and
 * `gtouch` the GNU "touch" (provided with `coreutils`)

When running on Linux, YMMV (replace/alias `gtouch` with `touch`).


Scraper scripts by default output to `*.warn` files (and are silent most of the time). Get a cup of coffee ;)


For the helpers, `mono` to run `Teddy.exe` (not `TeddyBench`!) and `opus2tonie` from https://github.com/bailli/opus2tonie are required.
